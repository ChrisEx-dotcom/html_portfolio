<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>	Hi there! I’m Chris Exline, a passionate fledgeling budding IT Guru based in Colorado Springs.
        I love my family, all things technology, and The Metal along with hiking in the mountains and video games.

<h1>My Jouney</h1>
    <p>	I started my journey in this world some years ago, and since then, I’ve been dedicated to living in this existence curious as to where it will take me.
        My favorite sayings are "we already know everything, we just don't know it", and "all those who wander aren't necessarily lost".
